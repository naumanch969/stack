Canvas:
    Screen on which 3d model is to be created
Suspense:
    component which render before the loading of components inside of it
mesh: 
    Any object we see, the car, cube, square
    Every mesh has two components atleast:
geometry:
    it's the shape of the mesh, like planeGeometry, boxGeometry, etc
material:
    it defines the material of the meshs, like rough, smooth, transparent, etc.
scene:
    
ambientLight:
    what we see in our daily life is because of light. So in case of canvas if we don't apply the light, we would not be able to see the colors of meshs (objects || items). Every thing would be black.
